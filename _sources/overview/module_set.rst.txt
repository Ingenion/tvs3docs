Module Set
==========
The following modules are available for the TVS 3.0 mainframe from Ingenion's eStore.  Module templates (electrical and mechanical) are freely provided by Ingenion allowing users to create their own custom modules.

Modules provide the physical interface to the outside world and can be used to add functionality to the TVS 3.0 mainframe.  Modules can be easily swapped in and out of the mainframe allowing users to quickly change the functionality of the system.  Modules are paired with FPGA logic blocks and/or software running on the Raspberry Pi-5 module to provide a complete solution for a wide range of applications.
